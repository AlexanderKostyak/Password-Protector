Short C++ Script to Copy and Erase Clipboard

The easiest way for a password to be compromised is someone watching you type it in.
This script uses the windows API to make clipboard modifications so that you can just paste in your passwords
It then erases the clipboard data, and your password is not visibly entered as perceived by your surroundings
